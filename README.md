## Major hurdles and unsolved problem

The biggest hurdle for this project was trying to fully grasp
how React functions. Before starting the project I watched a few
tutorials and felt overwhelmed. Trying to layout the complete structure
of the application was a bit of challenge to see how all the pieces
would fit together. During this project I felt that I was spending more
researching and reading and less time actually working on the code.
Another issue has been linking the client-side with the backend server. 
This caused a big set back on the development process and a lot of time 
trying to debugg this issue.
